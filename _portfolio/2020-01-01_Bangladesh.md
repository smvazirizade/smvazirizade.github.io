Inland Water Transportation (IWT) is one of the most environmental-friendly and cost-effective modes of transportation. In the case of a country like Bangladesh, due extreme weather events such as cyclones and monsoon floods, the development and maintenance cost of other modes of transportation is very high, which makes the role of IWT even more crucial. Various factors, including  global environmental changes, upstream flow rate, sedimentation and dredging, etc. can change the transportation capacity connectivity between the cities through rivers, which requires to be studied. Graph theory is well suited and employed to evaluate the IWT network of Bangladesh. Also, using image processing techniques the river changes are extracted over a period of time. Various metrics, including the size of the largest component, weighted global efficiency, and size of the connected population are considered to compare the intact IWT network and the impaired network affected by external factors.
