Sudden damage is the main and most dangerous reason forstructural failure. Therefore, structural health monitoring and reliability assessmentof structures have been the center of attention during the past decades. I havepublished multiple research papers focusing on using neural networks to improve structural reliability. Compared to other methods, it is fast, accurate,and economical. By starting the era of bigdata, more and more data isconsistently being collected, which can improve the performance of such data-driven models.  
This was the focus of my master's thesis and we published multiple research papers on this topic. Please refer to the [publication tab](/publications) for more detail.
