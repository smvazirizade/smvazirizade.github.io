Post Doctoral Research Fellow/Data Scientist

About me
======
I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Vanderbilt University, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. As a member of [SCOPE Lab](https://scopelab.ai/) (Smart and resilient Computing for Physical Environment) under the supervision of [Dr. Abhishek Dubey](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/abhishek-dubey),
I work on multiple projects including developing Artificial Intelligence agents for integrated data-driven technologies for smart cities and analyzing transportation systems using network science.  
I earned my PhD from the University of Arizona under the supervision of [Prof. Achintya Haldar](https://caem.engineering.arizona.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/achintya-haldar) 
focused on developing an intelligent integrated method for reliability estimation. Upon completion of my PhD, I also received [The Outstanding Graduate Student Award](https://news.engineering.arizona.edu/news/college-celebrates-fall-2019-standout-students) in 2019.  
Risk requires the modeling of the environment, which was another part of my research using statistical modeling. Additionally, I developed a model using Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) to imitate the response of a structure and find the location as well as the severity of the damage. Previously, I collaborated as a Data Scientist on an NEH funded project for developing a new [OCR technique](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcq2ciH_Eb0rDckJmS_p-XQ) using Computer Vision (CV) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and a hurricane predictive model using high-dimensional spatio-temporal data. I also received [Outstanding Graduate Student Award](https://news.engineering.arizona.edu/news/college-celebrates-fall-2019-standout-students) in 2019.  

A comical adage by renowned economist Ronald Coase says:  
<em>“If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything”.</em>  
Even though this statement is ambiguous, I would prefer to be optimistic and interpret this as using the correct tools to coerce the data to a correct confession.
The role of a data scientist is to find and apply the correct tool. I am passionate about working with numbers. Developing models to predict/imitate a behavior/feature is quite magical. I'm very interested in solving real-world problems by using machine learning and my data science knowledge. 
For fun, I follow Formula 1. It is, indeed, one of the most heavily-invested-in-data-science sports. During a race, thanks to the over 300 sensors on each car, more than 1.5GB of real-time data is transfered back to the engineers, [ref](https://www.mclaren.com/applied/blog/brain-of-an-f1-car-mclaren-ecu/#:~:text=With%20help%20from%20over%20300,over%20750%20million%20data%20points.).
