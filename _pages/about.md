Hi, welcome to my page.

About me
======
I'm a post-doctoral researcher at Vanderbilt University, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. As a member of [SCOPE Lab](https://scopelab.ai/) (Smart and resilient Computing for Physical Environment) under the supervision [Dr. Abhishek Dubey](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/abhishek-dubey), I work on multiple projects including developing Artificial Intelligence agents for integrated data-driven technologies for smart cities. I earned my PhD from the University of Arizona under the supervision of [Prof. Achintya Haldar](https://caem.engineering.arizona.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/achintya-haldar) focused on Novel Integrated Methods for Reliability Estimation of Dynamic Nonlinear Complex Systems. I am also the recipient of [Outstanding Graduate Student Award](https://news.engineering.arizona.edu/news/college-celebrates-fall-2019-standout-students) in 2019.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
