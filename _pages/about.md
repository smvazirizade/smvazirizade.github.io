Post Doctoral Research Fellow/Data Scientist



About me
======
I'm a post-doctoral researcher at Vanderbilt University, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. As a member of [SCOPE Lab](https://scopelab.ai/) (Smart and resilient Computing for Physical Environment) under the supervision [Dr. Abhishek Dubey](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/abhishek-dubey), I work on multiple projects including developing Artificial Intelligence agents for integrated data-driven technologies for smart cities. I earned my PhD from the University of Arizona under the supervision of [Prof. Achintya Haldar](https://caem.engineering.arizona.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/achintya-haldar) focused on Novel Integrated Methods for Reliability Estimation of Dynamic Nonlinear Complex Systems. I am also the recipient of [Outstanding Graduate Student Award](https://news.engineering.arizona.edu/news/college-celebrates-fall-2019-standout-students) in 2019.
